Before deploying, you'll need to copy `src/config.json.template` to
`src/config.json` and edit in your own settings.
Note: the resulting file is in gitignore.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
